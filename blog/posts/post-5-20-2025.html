    <h3>TLDR:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In-Game Collaboration</li>
            <li>Ease of Use</li>
            <li>Nearly Endless Possibilities</li>
            <li>Passionate Developers</li>
        </ul>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>For years I've dreamed of a VR platform that's truly willing to push the boundaries of what's possible—not just in terms of visuals or social features, but in how we create, connect, and collaborate in virtual spaces. I've poured countless hours into VRChat and talked with everyone from casual users to creators, moderators, and everyone in between. Despite all the creativity achieved in that space, the same concerns keep coming up: limitations on what can be built.</p>
    <h1>What makes Resonite Special?</h1>
        <p>In the constantly changing landscape of virtual worlds and creative platforms, one name is rapidly gaining recognition for its boundless potential: Resonite. More than just a game or a social hub, Resonite is truly unlike anything else out there. For me, its everything I've ever dreamed of in a sandbox experience, and I couldn't be more excited!</p>
    <h3>No extra third-party tools</h3>
        <p>One of the most compelling aspects of Resonite is its focus on in-game creation. Unlike many other VR platforms where you're limited to predefined external tools, Resonite allows users to construct worlds, avatars, and interactive systems directly inside the game.</p>
    <h3>Realtime Collaboration</h3>
        <p>You can build, modify, and experience content simultaneously with others in the same space. This real-time interactivity makes it an amazing platform not just for Social VR, but also for remote teamwork, design, education, and so much more! For example, if your avatar isn't working properly, you can simply let someone else edit and fix it for you.</p>
    <h3>Easy to understand Visual Scripting</h3>
        <p>Its visual programming system, ProtoFlux, allows creators to build complex behaviors without needing traditional code. This opens the door for people from all skill levels to contribute equally, from tinkerers to developers.</p>
    <h3>Nearly endless possibilites</h3>
        <p>Whether you want to build a car, an art gallery, or an interactive concert stage, Resonite gives you the power to do it all in one place. Its modular design and extensibility mean the platform can evolve along with its users.</p>
    <h3>Developers that care</h3>
        <p>Resonite's developers seem to value openness, user ownership, and technical innovation. And Resonite reflects those ideals in its ongoing development. It has strong support for user-made content, transparency in decision-making, and a welcoming atmosphere for newcomers.</p>

  <h1>Why not VRChat?</h1>
        <h3>TLDR:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Not a Sandbox.</li>
            <li>Misleading Advertising</li>
            <li>Ignoring Their Community</li>
            <li>Excessive Payments for Basic Features</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>VRChat is alright for chatting and basic creation, but its definitely not a sandbox game.</b></p>
          <break></break>
          <p>Its right there in the name: you get into VR, use an avatar, and chat with people. VRChat does this very well, fostering a fun, chaotic, and vibrant social platform, but its not what I'm looking for.</p>
          <h3>Misleading Advertising</h3>
          <p>It doesn't help that VRChat advertises itself in a misleading way. On their website, the first thing you read is "Create a Universe of Endless Possibilities." However, those possibilities are far from endless in the way a sandbox game's are. While users can create and share worlds and avatars, the core mechanics and interactions are primarily social and communicative, not about open-ended creation and "Endless Possibilites".</p>
          <h3>VRChat Consistently Falls Short.</h3>
          <p>There are plenty of other reasons I really don't like VRChat—from their seemingly tone-deaf developers who ignore community feedback, to locking basic features (Like profile pictures!) behind excessive monthly payments. It feels like they prioritize monetization over user experience, which makes the platform frustrating to support.</p>
